# Sturctural-Mechanics-in-Python
Structural mechanics: FEM With Python based on Thermal and mechanical loads
Determine the temperature and stress distribution in a composite plate subjected to thermal and mechanical loads.

The plate is made of a combination of metals and composites and has dimensions of 10 cm x 10 cm x 1 cm. It is subjected to a uniform temperature increase of 100°C and a mechanical load of 10 N in the z-direction. The thermal and mechanical properties of the plate are given below:

Thermal conductivity: k = 20 W/mK
Modulus of elasticity: E = 200 GPa
Poisson's ratio: v = 0.3
Thermal expansion coefficient: α = 1.2 × 10^(-5) K^(-1)
Density: ρ = 7850 kg/m^3
